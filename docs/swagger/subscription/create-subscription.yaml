    Creates a new subscription for a user with a specific plan and payment method.

    **Behavior:**
    - If the user has no subscription, a new one will be created with "pending" status
    - If the user has an "inactive" subscription, it will be reactivated
    - If the user has an "active" or "pending" subscription, it will return a 403 error
    - The priceId must match one of the configured plans (basic, standard, premium)
    - The subscription will be created in Stripe with a trial period based on the plan
    - Returns subscriptionId and clientSecret for payment confirmation
